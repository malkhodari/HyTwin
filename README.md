## Details on hypertension modelling
```
- Hypertension is a serious medical condition that affects over a billion people worldwide
- The proper management of disease progression requires an extended knowledge on the functional/structural changes in the whole body in response to hypertension
- We developed the HyperScore; an integrative and unified measure of hypertension progression relative to multi-modality measurements
- The HyperScore reflects the proximity of a participant from the healthy state and towards the diseased state [score range: 0 (low risk) â€“ 1 (high risk)]
- We provide another level of characterization of the progression mechanism by locating the participant on a disease progression trajectory map
- Each trajectory within the map reflects distinct hypertension-related end-organ progression pathway
- Trajectory 1: liver disease, Trajectory 2: brain diseases, Trajectory 3: heart diseases
- Trajectory 4: low survival (death from circulatory diseases), Trajectory 5: Metabolic diseases, Trajectory 6: Kidney diseases
- The built-in model was developed using a large participating cohort from the UK Biobank database (n=27,099) with over 500 imaging/non-imaging variables from multiple modalities.
- It is based on a semi-supervised machine learning approach; the contrastive trajectory inference (cTI)
